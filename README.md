## How to prepare your sample files

Single Sample Upload: 
Upload a csv file with your DNA methylation data for a specific sample. The first column should be the cpg labels that correspond to the DNA methylation values in the file. The second column should be your DNA methylation values. Make sure the top of the column with methylation data values is labeled with the sample name (e.g. Sample 1). 
Please refer to [individual01.csv](https://github.com/hayanlee/EnsembleMeAgingClock/blob/main/examples/individual01.csv)as an example.
